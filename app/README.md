# Open Coverage Frontend

The frontend of Open Coverage is written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

First, install all packages with NPM or Yarn:

```shell
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Second, run the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
